In order to run this project, the code need to be run on the MainActivity.ky file and on the android studio.  Path: app/src/main/java/com/supachai/guitarscales/MainActivity.kt

As this application uses Samsung Galaxy A14 5G as virtual device and physical device for testing so it should use the same device for testing.

If anyone who clone this project on the android studio but do not have Samsung Galaxy A14 5G as virtual machine. 
Please download the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G's enumulator skin by following the step in the links below.

the physical machine, the volume of sound is loud enough and good enough for real enviroment.
